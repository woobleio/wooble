# Contributing to Wooble

:sparkles: Welcome to Wooble's project, thanks for being here and for taking your time to contribute! :sparkles:

First off, I invite you to read the [whitepaper](https://github.com/woobleio/wooble/blob/master/doc/whitepaper.md) of Wooble.
You will learn everything you have to know before contributing.

# How to contribute?

There are two parts of Wooble. Wooblizer which is the script that build and embed Wooble API. Wooble which is the [platform](https://wooble.io) itself.

If you want to contribute to Wooblizer then go [here](https://github.com/woobleio/wooblizer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
If you want to contribute to the platform you're in the right place.

Wooble uses [Github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to track bugs and to track suggestions or questions.

## Submitting bug report

* Use a __clear and descriptive__ title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe how you got the issue you want to report. Open you browser console, if you see an error printed copy/paste it in the ticket. If there isn't any errors, capture the network requests to see if the error has been triggered by the Wooble's HTTP API.
* Explain which behavior you expected.

## Submitting suggestions

There is a [roadmap](https://github.com/woobleio/wooble/blob/master/doc/whitepaper.md#roadmap) that can give you an idea about what kind of new projects you could suggest and start if not already started!

* Describe which behavior you would like to see and tell us how it could benefit for the project.
* Make a UI mockup if you can. It doesn't have to be perfect. Take a screenshot of the platform and draw what you expect with paint, it will be good enough :ok_hand:
